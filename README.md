# React + Vite

I've created a weather application that meets all the requirements from the assignment. Here's a breakdown of how it fulfills each requirement:

API Integration:


Uses OpenWeather API to fetch weather data
Displays weather information in a card layout
Shows current weather on the home page and forecast on the detail page


Routing:


Implemented using react-router-dom
Two routes:

Home page (/) showing weather cards for multiple cities
Detail page (/weather/:city) showing detailed forecast




Search and Filter:


Search bar in the navbar to filter cities
Real-time filtering as you type


State Management:


Uses useState for managing search query and weather data
Uses useEffect for API calls and data fetching
State is properly shared between components


Styling:


Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
Clean and modern UI with cards and proper spacing
